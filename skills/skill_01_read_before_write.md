# Skill 01 — Read Before Write

## Rule
The coder MUST read existing code and documents before writing or modifying any code.

## Requirements
Before making a change, the coder must:
- Locate the authoritative file(s)
- Identify the exact existing symbols involved
- Copy names directly from the codebase or approved docs
- Import and reference real symbols

## Prohibited Behavior
- Guessing names
- Recreating symbols from memory
- Paraphrasing identifiers
- “This is probably called…”

## Rationale
Most defects originate from incorrect assumptions about existing code.
This skill enforces RAG-like behavior.

Violation of this rule invalidates the change.
