# Skill 05 — Full File Output Only

## Rule
Whenever a file is changed, the coder MUST output the entire file.

## Applies To
- Source code
- Tests
- Configuration files
- Documentation

## Prohibited
- Snippets
- Diffs
- Patches
- Ellipses
- “Unchanged code omitted”

## Rationale
Partial outputs cause copy/paste errors and missing context.

Any partial output invalidates the change.
