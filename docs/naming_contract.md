# Naming Contract

## Purpose
This document is the single source of truth for all naming rules in the repository.

Once a name is approved and recorded, it is immutable unless explicitly changed through the documented process.

---

## Rules

1. Every public name must exist in exactly one authoritative place.
2. Names must be imported and reused, never retyped from memory.
3. No new names may be introduced without explicit approval.
4. Renames are breaking changes and must be logged.
5. Code must never be the first place a name appears.

---

## Enforcement
Any change that violates this contract is invalid and must be reverted.
